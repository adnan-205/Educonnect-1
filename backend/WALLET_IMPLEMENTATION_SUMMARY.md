## üìä System Flow

### Automatic Wallet Credit Flow
```
1. Student pays 1000 BDT via SSLCommerz
2. Payment succeeds
3. payments.service.ts ‚Üí handleSuccess()
4. wallet.service.ts ‚Üí creditWallet()
5. Calculate commission: 1000 √ó 0.10 = 100 BDT
6. Net amount: 1000 - 100 = 900 BDT
7. Create CREDIT transaction (COMPLETED)
8. Update wallet: balance += 900, totalEarned += 900
9. Teacher sees 900 BDT in wallet
```

### Withdrawal Request Flow
```
1. Teacher requests 500 BDT withdrawal
2. System validates:
   - Balance >= 500? ‚úì
   - No pending withdrawal? ‚úì
3. Create WITHDRAWAL transaction (PENDING)
4. Admin views pending requests
5. Admin approves:
   - Update transaction status: COMPLETED
   - Deduct from balance: 900 - 500 = 400
   - Update totalWithdrawn: 0 + 500 = 500
6. Teacher sees updated balance: 400 BDT
```

## üîê Security Features

### Authentication & Authorization
- ‚úÖ JWT token required for all endpoints
- ‚úÖ Role-based access control (teacher/admin)
- ‚úÖ Teachers can only access their own wallet
- ‚úÖ Admins can manage all withdrawals

### Data Validation
- ‚úÖ Input validation using express-validator
- ‚úÖ Amount validation (positive numbers)
- ‚úÖ Withdrawal method validation
- ‚úÖ Rejection reason validation (min 10 chars)

### Transaction Safety
- ‚úÖ MongoDB sessions for atomic operations
- ‚úÖ Balance cannot go negative (schema validation)
- ‚úÖ Prevents duplicate pending withdrawals
- ‚úÖ Validates sufficient balance before withdrawal
- ‚úÖ Commission calculation with proper rounding
