## üõ† Management Commands

### View Service Status
```bash
docker compose ps
```

### View Logs
```bash
# All services
docker compose logs

# Specific service
docker compose logs web
docker compose logs prosody
docker compose logs jicofo
docker compose logs jvb

# Follow logs in real-time
docker compose logs -f
```

### Stop Services
```bash
# Stop all services
docker compose down

# Stop and remove volumes (clean slate)
docker compose down -v
```

### Restart Services
```bash
# Restart all services
docker compose restart

# Restart specific service
docker compose restart web

```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Port Already in Use
If you get an error about ports 80 or 443 being in use:
```bash
# Check what's using the port
sudo netstat -tulpn | grep :80
sudo netstat -tulpn | grep :443

# Stop the conflicting service or change ports in docker compose.yml
```

#### 2. Services Not Starting
```bash
# Check logs for errors
docker compose logs

# Check system resources
docker system df
docker system prune  # Clean up if needed
```

#### 3. Can't Access Jitsi at localhost
- Make sure all services are running: `docker compose ps`
- Check if port 80 is accessible: `curl http://localhost`
- Try accessing via IP: `http://127.0.0.1`
- Check firewall settings

#### 4. Audio/Video Issues
- Ensure your browser has camera/microphone permissions
- Try a different browser (Chrome/Firefox recommended)
- Check browser console for errors (F12 ‚Üí Console)

### Reset Everything
If you encounter persistent issues:
```bash
# Stop and remove everything
docker compose down -v

# Remove all Jitsi-related containers and images
docker system prune -a

# Start fresh
docker compose up -d
```
